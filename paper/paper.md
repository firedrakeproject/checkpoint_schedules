# Summary
The *checkpoint_schedules* is a Python package that prescribes the combination of an original forward computation together one adjoint computation. The *checkpoint_schedules* package provides a set of actions that define the forward and adjoint executions. Therefore, it is essential to import the actions from the *checkpoint_schedules* package to ensure proper functionality.

Hence, from the *checkpoint_schedules* library we import the actions used to execute our current adjoint-based gradient with the H-Revolve checkpointing method [2].
