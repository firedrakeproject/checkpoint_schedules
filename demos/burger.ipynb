    "## *checkpoint_schedule* application: adjoint-based gradient \n",
    "This user guideline describes an adjoint-based gradient computation using checkpointing given by *checkpointing_schedules* package. Therefore, we initally define the adjoint-based gradient and then the forward and adjoint solvers prescribed by  *checkpointing_schedules* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the application\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional (1D) problem where it aims to compute the gradient/sensitivity of an objective functional $I$  with respect to a control parameter. The objective functional, is given by the expression:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{2} u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau) \\, d x\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which measures the energy of a 1D velocity variable $u = u(x, t)$ governed by the 1D viscous Burgers equation, a nonlinear equation for the advection and diffusion on momentum:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0.\n",
    "\\tag{2},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $x \\in [0, L]$ is the space variable and $t$ represents the time variable. The boundary condition is $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$, where $L$ is the lenght of the 1D domain. The initial condition is given by $u(0, t) = u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to compute the adjoint-based gradient of the objective functional $I(u)$ with respect to the initial condition $u_0$. Hence, we need to define the adjoint system, which is a function of the forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation) and the objective functional of interest. The adjoint system can be obtained in either a continuous or discrete space. In the continuous space approach, the adjoint PDE is derived from the continuous forward PDE. On the other hand, the discrete space approach utilizes the discrete forward PDE to obtain a discrete adjoint system. Alternatively, a discrete adjoint can be obtained through algorithmic differentiation (AD). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the adjoint-based gradient is defined in the continuous space. Thus, the adjoint-based gradient is given by the expression:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u_0} \\delta u_0 = \\int_{\\Omega}  u^{\\dagger}(x, 0) \\delta u_0 \\, dx,\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $u^{\\dagger}(x, 0)$ is the adjoint variable governed by the adjoint system:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial t} + u^{\\dagger} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - u \\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "satisfying the boundary condition $u^{\\dagger} (0, t) = u^{\\dagger}(L, t) = 0$. In this case, the initial condition is $u^{\\dagger} (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The adjoint system time-reversed. Therefore, computing the adjoint-based gradient requires storing the forward solution for each time-step, since the adjoint equation depends on the forward solution as seen in adjoint equation (4). Additionally, the gradient expression (3) is a function of $u^{\\dagger} (0, t)$, which is the final adjoint time 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discretisation\n",
    "Both the forward and adjoint systems are discretised using the Finite Element Method (FEM), employing a discretisation methodology detailed in [1]. This methodology uses the Galerkin method with linear trial basis functions to obtain an approximate solution. The backward finite difference method is employed to discretise the equations in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coding\n",
    "The *BurgerGradAdj* class is implemented to set of functionalities for solving Burger's equation (2) and its corresponding adjoint equation (4), as well as computing the objective functional (1). The *BurgerGradAdj* class constructor is responsible for defining the spatial and temporal configurations required for solving the problem. It sets up the necessary parameters and initializes the problem domain. The `copy_fwd_data` function carries forward data copying from either RAM or disk. This data is then used as the initial condition in the forward solver restarting. The functions `store_ram` and `store_disk` are responsible for storing the forward data for restarting purposes. Additionally, the `store_adj_deps` function is responsible for storing the forward data required for the adjoint computation."
