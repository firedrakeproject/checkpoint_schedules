    "# Adjoint-based sensitivity computation using checkpoint_schedules package\n",
    "\n",
    "The checkpointing is a method in general employed to reduce the peak of memory usage in adjoint computations. Adjoint method is at the core of many scietific applications as sensitivity analyses in fluids, inverse proplems, topology optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the application\n",
    "Here, we presented the checkpointing given by checkpointing_schedules package in an one-dimensional problem where it aims to compute an adjoint-based gradient. Hence, let us consider the cost function given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    I(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau)}{u_0 u_0} \\, d x\n",
    "    \\label{cost_f} \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we intend to compute the sensitivity of the kinetic energy in a time $\\tau$ with respect to the initial condition. The variable $u = u(x, t)$ is governed by the viscous Burgers equation, a nonlinear equation for the advection and diffusion on momentum in one dimension:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\label{fwd} \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "which satisfies the boundary condition $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$. The initial condition is given by $u(0, t) = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the adjoint-based gradient, it is necessary to define the adjoint system that is given as a function of the forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation) and a cost/objective function of interest. The adjoint system can be obtained in a continuous or discrete space. The former deals with the continuous PDE to define the adjoint PDE in a continuous space, whereas the latter uses the discrete forward PDE to obtain a discrete adjoint system. Discrete adjoint can be also determined by an algorithmic differentiation (AD). In this example, we present the adjoint-based gradient determined in a continuous space, where it is used the Lagrange multiplier approach. Thus, the adjoint-based gradient is given by the following expression:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u_0} \\delta u_0 = \\int_{\\Omega}  u^{\\dagger}(x, 0) \\delta u_0 \\, dx,$$\n",
    "where $u^{\\dagger}(x, 0)$ is the solution of the adjoint system:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{-\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial t} + u^{\\dagger} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - u \\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\label{adj} \\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "which satisfies the boundary condition $u^{\\dagger} (0, t) = u(L, t)$. For the current adjoint sensitivity problem, the initial condition is $u^{\\dagger} (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The adjoint system is inverse in time, being the adjoint initial time $\\tau$ that is the final time of the forward equation. Therefore, to compute the adjoint based gradient means to store the forward solution of every time-step, since the adjoint equation depends of the forward solution. In addition, the gradient expression is at a function of the $u^{\\dagger} (0, t)$ that is final adjoint solution at the final adjoint time 0.  "
