    "# Computation of adjoint-based gradient with checkpoint_schedules package\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointing is a method employed to reduce the peak of memory usage in adjoint-based gradients, which are at the core of many scientific applications, such as sensitivity analyses in fluids, inverse problems, and topology optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the checkpoint_schedules package prescribes the combination of an original forward computation together one adjoint computation, e.g., when checkpoint data should be stored and loaded and when the forward or adjoint should advance. Therefore, this tutorial aims to apply checkpointing schedules to a simplified case of adjoint-based gradient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the application\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional problem where it aims to compute the gradient/sensitivity of an objective functional given by the expression below with respect to a control parameter:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    I(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau)}{u_0 u_0} \\, d x\n",
    "    \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable $u = u(x, t)$ is governed by the viscous Burgers equation, a nonlinear equation for the advection and diffusion on momentum in one dimension:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "which satisfies the boundary condition $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$. The initial condition is given by $u(0, t) = u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the goal is to compute the sensitivity of the objective functional $I(u)$ with respect to the initial condition $u_0$ that is the initial condition of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the adjoint-based gradient, it is necessary to define the adjoint system that is given as a function of the forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation) and an objective functional of interest. The adjoint system can be obtained in a continuous or discrete space. The former deals with the continuous PDE to define the adjoint PDE in a continuous space, whereas the latter uses the discrete forward PDE to obtain a discrete adjoint system. Discrete adjoint can be also determined by an algorithmic differentiation (AD). In this tutorial, we present the adjoint-based gradient defined in a continuous space that is given by the following expression:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u_0} \\delta u_0 = \\int_{\\Omega}  u^{\\dagger}(x, 0) \\delta u_0 \\, dx,$$\n",
    "where $u^{\\dagger}(x, 0)$ is the solution of an adjoint system that in the current case reads:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-\\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial t} + u^{\\dagger} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - u \\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    " \\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "satisfying the boundary condition $u^{\\dagger} (0, t) = u^{\\dagger}(L, t) = 0$. For the current adjoint-based gradient problem, the initial condition is $u^{\\dagger} (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the initial condition of the adjoint equation is given in the time $\\tau$. That means the adjoint system is inverse in time. Therefore, computing the adjoint-based gradient means storing the forward solution of every time-step since the adjoint equation depends on the forward solution. In addition, the gradient expression is at a function of the $u^{\\dagger} (0, t)$ that is the final adjoint solution at the final adjoint time 0.   "
