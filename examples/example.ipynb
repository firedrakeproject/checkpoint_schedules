    "## Using *checkpoint_schedules* package\n",
    "\n",
    "The *checkpoint_schedules* package offers a squedule of actions that enable the coordination of an adjoint-based gradient executions through a checkpoint strategy. The checkpoint schedule is built by the sequence of actions referred to as *Forward, EndForward, Reverse, Copy, EndReverse*. The actions provides functionalities such as storing the forward checkpoint data used to restart the forward solver, storing the forward checkpoint data for adjoint computations, and retrieving the stored data for both the forward solver restart and the adjoint computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we have implemented the `CheckpointingManager` class, which allows the manegement of the forward and adjoint executions in time. On using `CheckpointingManager.execute` method, we iterate over a sequence of actions given by the schedule `cp_schedule`. The actions are defined by using single-dispatch functions, where the `action` function is the generic function using the singledispatch decorator. Specific functions for different types of *checkpoint_schedules* actions are provided by using the register method of the base function `action`."
