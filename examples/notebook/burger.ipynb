    "# User guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "## *checkpoint_schedule* application: adjoint-based gradient \n",
    "This user guideline describes an adjoint-based gradient computation using checkpointing given by *checkpointing_schedules* package. Therefore, we initally define the adjoint-based gradient and then the forward and adjoint solvers prescribed by  *checkpointing_schedules* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the application\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional (1D) problem where it aims to compute the gradient/sensitivity of an objective functional $I$  with respect to a control parameter. The objective functional, is given by the expression:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{2} u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau) \\, d x\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which measures the energy of a 1D velocity variable $u = u(x, t)$ governed by the 1D viscous Burgers equation, a nonlinear equation for the advection and diffusion on momentum:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0.\n",
    "\\tag{2},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $x \\in [0, L]$ is the space variable and $t$ represents the time variable. The boundary condition is $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$, where $L$ is the lenght of the 1D domain. The initial condition is given by $u(0, t) = u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to compute the adjoint-based gradient of the objective functional $I(u)$ with respect to the initial condition $u_0$. Hence, we need to define the adjoint system, which is a function of the forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation) and the objective functional of interest. The adjoint system can be obtained in either a continuous or discrete space. In the continuous space approach, the adjoint PDE is derived from the continuous forward PDE. On the other hand, the discrete space approach utilizes the discrete forward PDE to obtain a discrete adjoint system. Alternatively, a discrete adjoint can be obtained through algorithmic differentiation (AD). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, the adjoint-based gradient is defined in the continuous space. Thus, the adjoint-based gradient is given by the expression:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u_0} \\delta u_0 = \\int_{\\Omega}  u^{\\dagger}(x, 0) \\delta u_0 \\, dx,\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $u^{\\dagger}(x, 0)$ is the adjoint variable governed by the adjoint system:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "-\\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial t} + u^{\\dagger} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - u \\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "satisfying the boundary condition $u^{\\dagger} (0, t) = u^{\\dagger}(L, t) = 0$. In this case, the initial condition is $u^{\\dagger} (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The adjoint system time-reversed. Therefore, computing the adjoint-based gradient requires storing the forward solution for each time-step, since the adjoint equation depends on the forward solution as seen in adjoint equation (4). Additionally, the gradient expression (3) is a function of $u^{\\dagger} (0, t)$, which is the final adjoint time 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discretisation\n",
    "We discretise both the forward and adjoint systems using the Finite Element Method (FEM), following the discretisation that is explained in detail in [1] that obtains the approximated solution by applying Galerkin method with linear trial basis functions. The adjoint system is also discretized with this same methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coding\n",
    "*BurgerGradAdj* provides the *forward* solver of Burger's equation (2), the *backaward* solver of the adjoint equation (4) and the computation of the objective funtional (1).  The constructor of the *BurgerGradAdj* class defines the spatial and temporal configurations for the problem. The forward equation system is implemented in the *forward* method, whereas the adjoint equation system is implemented in the *backward* method. "
