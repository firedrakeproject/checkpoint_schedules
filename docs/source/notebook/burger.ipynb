    "## Computation of adjoint-based gradient with checkpoint_schedules package\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate the application of checkpointing schedules in a simplified scenario of adjoint-based gradient computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the application\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional problem where it aims to compute the gradient/sensitivity of an objective functional given by the expression below with respect to a control parameter. The objective functional, denoted as $I(u)$, is given by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    I(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau)}{u_0 u_0} \\, d x\n",
    "    \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable $u = u(x, t)$ is governed by the viscous Burgers equation, a nonlinear equation for the advection and diffusion on momentum in one dimension:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "which satisfies the boundary condition $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$. The initial condition is given by $u(0, t) = u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the goal is to compute the sensitivity of the objective functional $I(u)$ with respect to the initial condition $u_0$ that is the initial condition of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the adjoint-based gradient, we need to define the adjoint system, which is a function of the forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation) and the objective functional of interest. The adjoint system can be obtained in either a continuous or discrete space. In the continuous space approach, the adjoint PDE is derived from the continuous forward PDE. On the other hand, the discrete space approach utilizes the discrete forward PDE to obtain a discrete adjoint system. Alternatively, a discrete adjoint can be obtained through algorithmic differentiation (AD).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we present the adjoint-based gradient defined in a continuous space that is given by the following expression:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u_0} \\delta u_0 = \\int_{\\Omega}  u^{\\dagger}(x, 0) \\delta u_0 \\, dx,\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $u^{\\dagger}(x, 0)$ is the solution of an adjoint system that in the current case reads:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-\\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial t} + u^{\\dagger} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - u \\frac{\\partial u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u^{\\dagger}}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "satisfying the boundary condition $u^{\\dagger} (0, t) = u^{\\dagger}(L, t) = 0$. For the current adjoint-based gradient problem, the initial condition is $u^{\\dagger} (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the initial condition of the adjoint equation is given at time $\\tau$, making the adjoint system time-reversed. Therefore, computing the adjoint-based gradient requires storing the forward solution for each time-step since the adjoint equation depends on the forward solution as seen in adjoint equation (4). Additionally, the gradient expression (3) is a function of $u^{\\dagger} (0, t)$, which represents the final the final adjoint time 0.   "
