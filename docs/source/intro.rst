Introduction
============
The time-dependent adjoint-based gradient is characterised by its backward progression in time and 
its dependence on the solution of a forward system. Consequently, the time-dependent adjoint 
requires either storing the forward data or recomputation of the forward problem to obtain essential 
data for the adjoint computations.

Storing the forward data at every time step is impractical for large systems, as it can result in high
memory usage for extensive time executions. This challenge can be overcome by employing the 
checkpointing method, which is an efficient manages memory usage [3, 5]. In summary, checkpointing strategies 
involve creating a sequence of schedules that coordinate the selective storage of forward data at specific time steps. 
During the adjoint computation, these schedules provide instructions for restarting the forward solver from the nearest 
time step where forward data was stored, in case the forward data is unavailable, until the step where the adjoint 
needs to be computed. 

In the adjoint-based gradient computation, the forward data used as initial conditions for the forward solver restarting can differ 
from the forward data required for the adjoint computation, e. g., for non-linear problems. Thus, we propose the *checkpoint_schedules* 
Python package the schedule distinguishes between the storage of forward restart data and the forward data required for the adjoint 
computation. The *checkpoint_schedules* package offers schedules given by a sequence of actions that provides functionalities 
of forward or adjoint advancement over the entire interval of steps. The *checkpoint_schedules* package explicitly incorporates data
buffering in an intermediate storage, ensuring that forward variables can be defined and computed before storage in a checkpoint. 
Furthermore, the *checkpoint_schedules* package is flexible to interpret and convert designs from various existing approaches, 
including the revolve algorithm. It has already been successfully working with the multistage approach [2], the two-level mixed 
periodic/binomial [6], and H-Revolve schedules [4]. 

The *checkpoint_schedules* also provides a generator able to iterate over the schedules and return the next action to perform. To advance 
in the basics of *checkpoint_schedules* employment and the generator usage, we recommend to read the following 
:ref:`section <example_checkpoint_schedules>`.
