    "# Using *checkpoint_schedules*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to introduce the usage of *checkpoint_schedules* for step based incremental checkpointing of the adjoints to computer models. This tutorial aims to reach illustrative purposes only. However, the code is fully functional and can be used as a starting point for more complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing the forward and adjoint executions with  schedules\n",
    "We initially write the `CheckpointingManager` class, which is intended to manage the execution of forward and adjoint models using a checkpointing schedule. `CheckpointingManager` constructor takes the argument `max_n`, which represents the maximum number of steps for the models execution. The attributes `index_action` and `list_actions` are used only for illustration matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CheckpointingManager` has the method `execute` to manage the step executions of the forward and adjoint models. `execute` takes the `cp_schedule` parameter that expects to be a generator given by *checkpoint_schedules* package. Inside of `execute`, the code iterates over elements in the `cp_schedule` by using a `for` loop. The iteration reached with `enumerate(cp_schedule)` returns a tuple `(count, cp_action)` where `count` is the list index, and `cp_action` is a *checkpoint_schedules* action. The latter is argument of a single-dispatch generic function `action` designed to handle different types of actions using specific functions. A specific function is for instance the `action_forward` that is registered to handle the `Forward` action. Hence, if `cp_action` is the *Forward* action, the `action_forward` function is called and inside of this specific function we can either implement or call any code required to execute the forward model. Analogously with the other *checkpoint_schedules* actions *Reverse*, *Copy*, *Move*, *EndForward* and *EndReverse*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* The *checkpoint_schedules* action will treated with more details in the following section of this tutorial.\n",
    "* The codes insider of the specific functions are intended to be illustrative only. Hence, we only added symbolic print statements to illustrate the execution of the forward and adjoint models.\n"
