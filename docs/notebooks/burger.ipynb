    "# *checkpoint_schedule* application: Adjoint-Based Gradient with the Burger's Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows adjoint-based gradient computation using the *checkpointing_schedules* package. We initially define the adjoint-based gradient problem and then present the forward and adjoint solvers prescribed by the *checkpointing_schedules* package.\n",

    "## Defining the application\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional (1D) problem aiming to compute the gradient/sensitivity of the kinetic energy at a time $t=\\tau$ with respect to an initial condition $u_0$. Then, our functional can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(u(x, \\tau, u_0)) = \\int_\\Omega \\frac{1}{2} u(x, \\tau, u_0)u(x, \\tau, u_0) \\, dx.\n",
    "\\tag{1} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current case, the velocity variable $u = u(x, t)$ is governed by the 1D viscous Burgers equation, a non-linear equation for the advection and diffusion of momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0.\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $x \\in [0, L]$ is the space variable, and $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ represents the time variable. The boundary condition is $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$, where $L$ is the length of the 1D domain. The initial condition is given by $u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control parameter is the initial condition $u_0$. Hence, the objective is to compute the adjoint-based gradient of the functional $I(u_0)$ with respect to $u_0$.\n",

    "## Adjoint-based gradient\n",
    "We wain to compute the sensitivity/gradient $\\mathrm{d}\\widehat{I}/\\mathrm{d}u_0$, where $\\widehat{I} = I(u_0)$ is the reduced functional. On applying the chain rule, we have the below expression on considering the functional $I$ as in Eq. (1).\n",

    "\n",
    "In summary, the adjoint system is defined by using the relation of the functional $I$ with the forward equation $F(u, u_0)$. Taking the total derivative of $F(u, u_0)$ with respect to $u_0$ yields a relationship for the solution Jacobian $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}u_0$:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}u_0} F(u, u_0) = \\frac{\\partial F(u, u_0)}{\\partial u} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}u_0} + \\frac{\\partial F(u, u_0)}{\\partial u_0} = 0 \\\\\n",
    " \\implies \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}u_0} = - \\left(\\frac{\\partial F(u, u_0)}{\\partial u}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{\\partial F(u, u_0)}{\\partial u_0}.$$\n",
    "Substituting $\\mathrm{d}u/\\mathrm{d}u_0$ into Eq. (3), we have:\n",

    "We can avoid the inverse $\\left(\\frac{ \\partial F(u, u_0)}{\\partial u}\\right)^{-1}$ computation by taking the adjoint (Hermitian transpose) of the above equation:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\widehat{I}}{\\mathrm{d}u_0}^* = - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u_0}^* \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u}^{-*} \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u}^{*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define:\n",
    "$$\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F(u, u_0)}{\\partial u}\\right)^{-*} \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u}^* \n",

    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\widehat{I}}{\\mathrm{d} u_0}^* = - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u_0}^* \\lambda.$$\n",

    "The adjoint PDE is then solved in a reverse time order and it depends as observed in Jacobian in Eq. (7). It is therefore necessary to have access to the relevant forward data. Storing the entire forward solution uses storage linear linear in the number of time steps, which can exhaust the available storage. To overcome this kind of problem, checkpointing algorithms are used to reduce the memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To employ a checkpointing method in the adjoint-based sensitivity calculation, we define a `CheckpointingManager` to manage the execution of forward and adjoint models. The `CheckpointingManager` defines the `execute` method, which performs each action specified in a provided checkpoint schedule (`_schedule`). Within the `execute` method, we have the single-dispatch generic `action` function that is overloaded by particular functions. For instance, if the `checkpoint_schedule` action is `Forward`, the `action_forward` function is called, and this can advance the forward calculation. In this particular example, the forward solver is executed by calling `self.equation.forward`. Here, `self.equation` is an attribute of `CheckpointingManager`. Similarly, the adjoint solver is executed by calling `self.equation.adjoint` within the `action_reverse` function."
