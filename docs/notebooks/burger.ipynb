    "# *checkpoint_schedule* application: adjoint-based gradient with Burger's equation\n",
    "This notebook aims to present the usage of the `checkpoint_schedules` package in an adjoint-based sensitivity problem. We begin by defining the adjoint-based gradient problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the application\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional (1D) problem where it aims to compute the gradient/sensitivity of an objective functional $I$  with respect to a control parameter. In the current case, consider the initial condition $u_0$ as the control parameter, and the objective functional given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(u(x, \\tau)) = \\int_{\\Omega} 0.5 \\, u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau) \\, d x\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\tau \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ is the final time. The velocity variable $u = u(x, t)$ is governed by the 1D viscous Burgers equation, a nonlinear equation for the advection and diffusion on momentum:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n",
    "\\tag{2},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $x \\in [0, L]$ is the space variable. The boundary condition is $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$, where $L$ represents the lenght of the 1D domain. The initial condition is here given by $u(0, t) = u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this current case, we aims to measure the sensitivity of the objective functional $I(u(x, \\tau))$ with respect to the initial condition $u_0$ using the adjoint-based gradient method. Therefore, we need initially to define the adjoint-based gradient expression that is here set by using the continuous formulation, which means the sensitivity is obtained from the continuous forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation). In this case, let us consider an augmented functional $J$ given by:\n",
    "$$J(u, \\lambda, u_0) = I(u(x, \\tau)) - \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\int_{\\Omega}  \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\right)\\, d x \\, d t, $$\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multipliers also referred to as the adjoint variable. The adjoint-based gradient expression is obtained by applying the Gateaux differentiation of the augmented functional $J(u, \\lambda, u_0)$ with respect to the initial condition $u_0$, which results in:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial u_0} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\lambda (x, 0) \\, \\delta u_0 \\, dx\\tag{3}$$\n",
    "Notice that the gradient expression depends of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which is obtained by solving an adjoint equation. The adjoint equation is obtained by applying the Gateaux differentiation of the augmented functional $J(u, \\lambda, u_0)$ with respect to the state variable $u$, which results in:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial t} - \\lambda\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + u \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial x} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\lambda}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "satisfying the boundary condition $\\lambda (0, t) = \\lambda(L, t) = 0$. In this case, the initial condition is $\\lambda (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjoint equation (4) is solved backward in time, i.e., the adjoint equation is solved from the final time $\\tau$ to the initial time $t=0$. Therefore, compute the adjoint-based gradient requires storing the forward solution for each time-step, since the adjoint equation depends on the forward solution as seen in adjoint equation (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Burger's equation discretisation\n",
    "Both the forward and adjoint systems are discretised using the Finite Element Method (FEM), employing a the spatial discretisation detailed in [1]. This methodology uses the Galerkin Continuous method with linear trial basis functions to obtain an approximate solution. The backward finite difference method is employed to discretise the equations in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "As the previous example, we use the `CheckpointingManager` class intending to manage the execution of forward and adjoint models using a checkpointing schedule. The `CheckpointingManager` has the method `execute` that executes every single action given the checkpointing schedule by iterating over the elements of the `cp_schedule`. Inside the `execute` method, we have the `action` function, which is a single-dispatch generic function. The `action` function is overloaded by the `action_forward`, `action_adjoint`, `action_copy`, `action_move`, `action_end_forward` and `action_end_reverse` according to the actions reached by the iterations over the elements of the `cp_schedule`, e.g., if the action is `Forward`, then the `action_forward` function is called and inside this function, we can implement the necessary code to advance the forward equation. In this current example, we execute the forward solver by calling `self.equation.forward`. Notice that the `self.equation` is an attribute of `CheckpointingManager`. Thus, this attribute would have a `forward` method that executes the forward solver. In addition, in `action_copy` and `action_move`, we add the `self.equation.copy_data`, ..."

    "The `TwoLevelCheckpointSchedule` also employes a mixed storage in RAM and on disk. This schedule does not require the maximal step `model[\"max_n\"]` to be defined before the forward solver execution. `TwoLevelCheckpointSchedule` saves the forward data in RAM or on disk according to the `period` argument, e.g., if `period=2`, then the forward data is stored in RAM or on disk every two steps. In the reverse computation, which involves the the execution of the adjoint solver and the forward solver to compute the adjoint dependency, the  user can define the aditional foward restart data storage in RAM or on disk according. The aditional forward restart data storage is defined the second argument of the `TwoLevelCheckpointSchedule` schedule. In the example, below, we define the `model[\"chk_ram\"]` to 1. The storage type is defined by the `binomial_storage` argument."
