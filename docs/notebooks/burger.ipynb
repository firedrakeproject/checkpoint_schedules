    "# *checkpoint_schedule* application: Adjoint-Based Gradient with Burger's Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "This user example shows adjoint-based gradient computation using the *checkpointing_schedules* package. We initially define the adjoint-based gradient problem and then present the forward and adjoint solvers prescribed by the *checkpointing_schedules* package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the application\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a one-dimensional (1D) problem aiming to compute the gradient/sensitivity of an objective functional $I$ with respect to a control parameter. The objective functional is given by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I(u) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{1}{2} u(x, \\tau)u(x, \\tau) \\, dx\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures the energy of a 1D velocity variable $u = u(x, \\tau)$ at a time $\\tau$, where $u$ is governed by the 1D viscous Burgers equation, a non-linear equation for the advection and diffusion of momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0.\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $x \\in [0, L]$ is the space variable, and $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ represents the time variable. The boundary condition is $u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0$, where $L$ is the length of the 1D domain. The initial condition is given by $u(0, t) = u_0 = \\sin(\\pi x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The control parameter is the initial condition $u_0$. Thus, the objective is to compute the adjoint-based gradient of the cost function $I(u)$ with respect to $u_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example sets the adjoint equation from the continuous formulation, meaning the adjoint PDE is obtained from the continuous forward PDE (Partial Differential Equation). The adjoint-based gradient is given by the expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d I}{d u_0} = \\int_{\\Omega}  \\lambda(x, 0) \\delta u_0 \\, dx,\n",
    "\\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda(x, 0)$ is the adjoint variable governed by the adjoint system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial t} - \\lambda \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + u \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial x} + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 \\lambda}{\\partial x^2} = 0,\n",
    "\\tag{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "satisfying the boundary condition $\\lambda (0, t) = \\lambda(L, t) = 0$. In this case, the initial condition is $\\lambda (x, \\tau) = u(x, \\tau)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the adjoint equation is solved from the initial time $t = \\tau$ to the final time $\\tau = 0$ the adjoint equation depends on the forward solution (see the adjoint equation (4)), it is necessary to store the forward state variable. Storing the entire forward state in preparation for the adjoint calculation has a memory footprint linear in the number of time steps. For sufficiently large problems this will exhaust the\n",
    "memory of any computer system. To overcome this kind of problem, checkpointing algorithms are used to reduce the memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checkpointing manager implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the [illustrative example](https://nbviewer.org/github/firedrakeproject/checkpoint_schedules/blob/main/docs/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb), we define the `CheckpointingManager` class to manage the execution of forward and adjoint models with a checkpointing schedule. The `CheckpointingManager` contains the `execute` method, which performs each action specified in the checkpointing schedule (`_schedule`). Within the `execute` method, the single-dispatch generic function `action` function is employed. `action` is overloaded by the `action_forward`, `action_adjoint`, `action_copy`, `action_move`, `action_end_forward`, and `action_end_reverse` functions. These functions correspond to different actions reached during the iterations over the elements of the `cp_schedule`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the action is `Forward`, the `action_forward` function is called. Within this function, the necessary code is implemented to progress the forward equation. In this particular example, the forward solver is executed by calling `self.equation.forward`. Here, `self.equation` is an attribute of `CheckpointingManager`. Similarly, the adjoint solver is executed by calling `self.equation.adjoint` within the `action_reverse` function.\n"
